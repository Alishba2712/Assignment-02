    <h1>Web Development Terms</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>HTML</dt>
        
        <dd>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content for 
            web pages, defining the layout and organization of text, images, and other elements using tags that web 
            browsers interpret and display. It serves as the foundation of the web, providing the "bones" of a 
            webpage's structure, which is then styled with CSS and made interactive with JavaScript</dd>
            <br>
            <dt>CSS</dt>
            
            <dd>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a 
                document written in a markup language, most commonly HTML. It defines how HTML elements are displayed
                 on screen, paper, or other media, controlling aspects such as colors, fonts, layout, spacing, and 
                 animations. CSS separates the content (HTML) from its visual presentation, allowing for consistent 
                 styling across multiple web pages and easier maintenance. </dd>
                 <br>
                 <dt>JAVASCRIPT</dt>
                
                 <dd>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create interactive 
                    and dynamic content on web pages. It works alongside HTML (for structure) and CSS (for styling) 
                    to provide behavior and functionality to websites, allowing for features like animations, interactive
                     forms, and real-time updates. While initially designed for client-side web development, its use 
                     has expanded to server-side applications (with Node.js) and other areas</dd>
